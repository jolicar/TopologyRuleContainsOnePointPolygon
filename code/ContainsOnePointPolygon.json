The evaluated polygons without points make the rule False too. The red polygons does the rule false. In 2DM, 3D and 3DM formats, the Z coordinate or M coordinate are ignored.\n \n NOTE 1: If the Tolerance equals zero, the rule does as above. If the tolerance is greater than zero, the scrip does a polygon buffer with tolerance value.

For Multipoints, if only one of these geometries are inside of polygon's area, the rule returns True. "
